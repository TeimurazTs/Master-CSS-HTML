  In 1980, physicist <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, a contractor at
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>, proposed and prototyped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE">ENQUIRE</a> , a
  system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee
  wrote a memo proposing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>-based
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> system.

<p>
  <strong>HTML</strong> 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the
  first version developed and standardized exclusively by the
  <strong>W3C</strong>, as the <strong>IETF</strong> had closed its
  <strong>HTML Working Group</strong> on September 12, 1996. Initially
  code-named "Wilbur", <strong>HTML</strong> 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely,
  reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of
  Netscape's visual markup tags. <strong>Netscape's blink</strong> element and
  <strong>Microsoft's</strong> marquee element were omitted due to a mutual
  agreement between the two companies.
</p>

<p>
  A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not
  standardized until 14 months later in MathML.
